Ncdu is a simple terminal utility to help you clean up your disk.

Here's why you should use this program:
- It lists directories ordered by size
- Allows interaction with directories through the program
- Lightweight ( below 1MB )
- Vim keybinds (always a plus)

## Getting started

To run it, type ncdu followed by the directory you want to scan:

`ncdu directory_name`

The keybinds are very intuitive
but here's a summary anyways:
- Move around with the arrow keys (or j,k)
- Move to parent directory with backspace
- Remove directories with "d"
- Rescan current directory with "r"
