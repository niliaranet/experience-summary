A while ago, I tried creating a markdown processor in rust
for my personal website,
but that became very spaguettic.
Hugo does the same but better!

## So what is Hugo?
Hugo is not a person.
It's a framework. It builds things!

To make a site with Hugo,
write the content down in markdown
(which is easier than plain text).
Then, process it with a theme and you got it!
Also, nginx is all you need to deploy the site:
no bs required.

### Getting started
Hugo has 2 main concepts: templating and writting.
It's tricky because you can't have one without the other,
so you have to learn both at once.

The way I started was by cloning the
[Hugo Bare Bones](https://about-hugo.github.io/examples/hugo-bare-bones/)
template and start tinkering with it.
It has a very minimal configuration that makes it easy
for simple minds like mine to understand.

Remember to read the docs at [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io)!
They're very well done.
